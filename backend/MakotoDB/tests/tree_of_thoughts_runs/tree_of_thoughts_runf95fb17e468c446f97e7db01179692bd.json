Since none are given here, I need to read the problem literally as \u2018use ANY four numbers\u2019 rather than specific ones, and produce a single expression with +-*/ that equals 24.\u201d  \nEvaluation: 0.9 (accurate interpretation, though could be clearer).\n\nThought 2: \u201cPick four convenient integers whose combinations make 24\u2014say 4, 3, 2, 1. A quick valid path is (4 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 1) = 24, but that\u2019s not the shortest single-line formula. Better to combine them all in one expression.\u201d  \nEvaluation: 0.8 (good choice of numbers, but still optimizing).\n\nThought 3: \u201cUsing the same numbers 4, 3, 2, 1, the single-line formula 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24 uses all four numbers once and only basic operations. It satisfies \u2018one equation\u2019.\u201d  \nEvaluation: 1.0 (meets every requirement).\n\nFinal Answer:  \n4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24",
