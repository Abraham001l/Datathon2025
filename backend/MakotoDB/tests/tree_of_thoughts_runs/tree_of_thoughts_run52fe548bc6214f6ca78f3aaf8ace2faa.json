We'll pick common numbers that easily yield 24.\n\n**Thought 1:** Choose 4, 6, 2, 1. Can we combine these to get 24?\n- (6 * 4) * (2 - 1) = 24 * 1 = 24. This works.\n- **Evaluation:** 1.0 (Simple and correct).\n\n**Thought 2:** Choose 8, 3, 2, 1. Can we combine these to get 24?\n- (8 * 3) * (2 - 1) = 24 * 1 = 24.

This works.\n- **Evaluation:** 1.0 (Simple and correct).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n(6 * 4) * (2 - 1) = 24",
