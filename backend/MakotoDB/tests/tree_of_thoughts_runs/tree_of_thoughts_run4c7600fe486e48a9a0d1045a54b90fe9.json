With them, (6+6+6+6)=24, but this is three additions, not a single equation combining all four via +-*/.  I need a single expression that uses each 6 exactly once.  The product 6\u00d76\u00d76\u00d76=1296 is too large, so a mix of ops is required.  \nSelf-evaluation: 0.6 (good exploration, but using four identical numbers plus multiple additions feels inelegant).\n\nThought 3: Switch to 8, 3, 4, 1.

Picking 4, 4, 4, 4 is the simplest choice because 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 is 256 \u2260 24\u2014so that fails.

Try 8, 8, 3, 3. (8\u00d78) \u2013 (3\u00d73) = 64 \u2013 9 = 55 \u2260 24. Next, 8, 3, 3, 1: 8\u00d73\u00d73\u00d71=72; no.
