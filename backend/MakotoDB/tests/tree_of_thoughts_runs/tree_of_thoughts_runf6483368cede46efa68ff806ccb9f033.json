The equation must be mathematically valid and use all four numbers exactly once. \n\nHowever, the prompt does not provide the four numbers to use. This is a critical omission, as the problem cannot be solved without knowing which numbers to work with. \n\n### Generating Thoughts\nGiven that the four numbers are missing, the only possible approach is to state that the problem cannot be solved without them. \n\n**Thought 1:** The problem cannot be solved because the four numbers to use are not provided.  \n- **Evaluation:** 1.0 (This is accurate and complete; the missing numbers make the problem unsolvable as stated.)\n\n### Final Answer\nSince the four numbers are not provided, the problem cannot be solved. However, to adhere strictly to the instruction \"return only the math,\" here is a placeholder response indicating the incompleteness:\n\n**Math:** [Numbers not provided - cannot solve]  \n\n**Final Evaluation:** 0.1 (The answer cannot be complete due to missing information, but this is the only truthful response possible.)",
